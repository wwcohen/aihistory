TTT?
 - need to generalize/move state canonicalization to State

Points to make
 - boxes is reinforcement learning formulation (not algorithm)
   - vs Samuel's game-playing method
 - boxes algorithm is 'made of numbers (probabilities) not
   heuristics'
    - Q as example, can I describe black's strategy with heuristics?
      - maybe added a little lookahead (eg, one move) would
        make the rest of the strategy easier?
      - alternative: could use 'how to lose TTT'
 - learning gets harder the better you get and the more you have to learn
 - real learning requires generalization
 - RL is used to make LLMs friendly

 - lots of different motivations and questions
   - delayed reward / credit assignment
   - optimal control
   - game playing
   - generalization better underlying learning
   - understanding natural learning
     - dopamine and td-lambda
     - bayesian info gathering
